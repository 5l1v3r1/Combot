## Installation - Windows

1) Download the Release.zip from the latest release in https://github.com/uncled1023/Combot/releases and extract the files to a directory of your choice.<br>
2) Edit Combot.Servers.config to configure the bot for the correct servers, channels, owner information, and MySQL database.<br>
3) If the database has not been created yet, import Database.sql from the master branch into the database.<br>
4) Run Combot-Interface.exe

## Installation - Linux

This is currently untested and not supported.  If you would like to venture into the realm of unreliability and errors, you can try running the Console Interface in Mono. 

## Building

To fully maximise the potential of Combot's ease of development, Visual Studios 13 should be installed.  If you have Visual Studios installed, you can add **Module Template.zip** to your project templates to easily create new modules.  If you do not want to use a template, you can copy an existing module and work from there.
